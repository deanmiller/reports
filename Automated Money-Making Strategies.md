# Comparison of Automated Money-Making Strategies: Affiliate Marketing, Faceless YouTube Channels, and AI Bot Crypto Trading

## Overview

- **Affiliate Marketing:** Earn commissions by promoting other companies’ products or services. You drive traffic to a merchant’s website via special links and earn a percentage of sales. It involves creating content (blogs, reviews, social media, email marketing) to recommend products. Over time, successful affiliate sites or campaigns can generate passive income.
- **Faceless YouTube Channels:** Create video content on YouTube without showing your face. Use narration (AI-generated voices or voiceovers), stock footage, animations, or text-to-speech. The channel builds an audience and monetizes via YouTube ads, affiliate links, or sponsorships.
- **AI Bot Crypto Trading:** Automated trading in cryptocurrency markets using algorithmic bots. These bots connect to exchanges via API and execute trades on your behalf based on predefined strategies or real-time signals. Some use AI to optimize trading decisions.
